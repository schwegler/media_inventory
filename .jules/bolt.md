## 2026-06-18 - Optimized Polymorphic Bulk Fetching
**Learning:** In this codebase, the `Activity` feed and "Popular Items" sections use polymorphic associations (`trackable`) that mix various media models. Standard polymorphic `includes` can be inefficient or fail if models have different associations (e.g., some have `cover_image`, others like `TvEpisode` don't).
**Action:** When bulk fetching polymorphic items, group by `trackable_type`, then perform a bulk query per type. Use `reflect_on_association` to conditionally include Active Storage attachments (like `cover_image_attachment: :blob`) to eliminate N+1 queries during view rendering while ensuring type safety.

## 2026-06-19 - Risks of Nested Eager Loading on Polymorphic Associations
**Learning:** Eager loading nested associations on a polymorphic relation (e.g., `includes(trackable: { tv_show: :user })`) will raise an `ActiveRecord::AssociationNotFoundError` if *any* of the returned records belong to a model that does not define that nested association (e.g., a `Movie` or `Album` which doesn't have a `tv_show`).
**Action:** Stick to first-level eager loading for polymorphic associations (`includes(:trackable)`) or use the grouping/bulk-fetch pattern if nested associations are required for specific types. Also, use `.load` in the controller if the view uses `.any?` or `.exists?` to prevent redundant COUNT queries before the SELECT.

## 2026-06-28 - Preloading Nested Attachments on Polymorphic Records
**Learning:** Even when using a centralized `RecordPreloader` to handle polymorphic associations, it's easy to miss nested associations that have their own attachments. User avatars are frequently rendered next to activities and posts, but were not being preloaded when the polymorphic `trackable` was fetched.
**Action:** When preloading standard associations (like `:user`) for polymorphic collections, always include their critical attachments (like `avatar_attachment: :blob`) to eliminate N+1 queries during view rendering of social feeds.
